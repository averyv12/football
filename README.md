# football
All of these files are what I used during my Summer 2023 independent study.
I was tasked with working with football plays from Stanford games versus Colgate and USC.
Tasks carried out by the files include:
- Parsing video into different camera angles based on changes in color histograms
- Finding the first frame of every play and storing that frame number in a file
- Creating a vertical concatenation of 5 frames before and after a cut frame (used to
sanity check my program was correct)
- Creating webpages, both on localhost and universally, that displayed concatenated images
